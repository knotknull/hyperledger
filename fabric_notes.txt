Hyperledger Fabric:
	- private
	- permissioned
	- members enroll via Membership Service Provider (MSP)
	- ledger data can be stored in multiple formats
	- swappable consensus mechanisms
	- different MSPs supported
	- channels can be created amont participants (separate ledger transactions)

Ledger has two components:
	- world state: describes state of ledger at given point 
	- transaction log: records all transactions which resulted in current value of world state

NOTE: each particiapnt has a copy of the ledger to every Hyperledger Fabric network they belong to
      replaceble world state data store (LevelDB).

Smart contract:  written in chaincode.  Invoked by application external to blockchain.
                 most cases, cahincode interacts with database component of ledger (querying it)
		 chaincode implemented in go and node.
